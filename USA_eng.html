                            <p class="text1">In America everything is "supersized‚Äù - even a "small‚Äù drink can become something no one in Europe would expect. Restaurant dishes often are so big, that two people could eat out of the same plate, or fast food chains always compete, who will offer a more extraordinary burger or dessert. And, if you think that no one could eat such a portion - you‚Äôre wrong.</p>

                            <p class="text2">Americans adore ice in drinks - if you order water in a restaurant, you will most likely get an almost full glass of ice with a splash of water. Even in winter, most people like soft drinks with a huge portion of ice, and coffee chains offer more types of cold coffee than hot. If you‚Äôre used to room-temperature drinks, it may be that in the US you‚Äôll miss tea without ice.</p>

                            <p class="text3">When autumn comes, it looks like everything in America turns in to a pumpkin patch - pumpkin spice coffee, pumpkin-scented candles, pumpkin-flavoured pies and even pumpkin-scented hand soap. "Pumpkin spice‚Äù mania starts in September and takes over the whole country until Thanksgiving day. Even people, who say that they hate the pumpkin flavour, still buy at least one pumpkin drink - after all, it‚Äôs a tradition!</p>

                            <p class="text4">Inches, feet, pounds, gallons and miles - the US is one of the few countries, which still doesn‚Äôt use the metric system. That means, that foreigners often get lost trying to understand, exactly how much is a "quarter pound burger‚Äù or why there‚Äôs +80 degrees outside (in Fahrenheit!). Even Americans sometimes don‚Äôt understand their measurement system, but no one intends to change it.</p>

                            <p class="text5">In movies they‚Äôre depicted as secret clubs with weird traditions, but in reality they are a serious part of the culture of American students. Sororities and fraternities give students socials ties, throw parties and even help in their career path. It is true, that getting in is not always easy - there are special initiation rituals and even peculiar "christenings" that sometimes resemble movie scenes.</p>

                            <p class="text6">In the cities of USA public transport is often poor and distances are long, which is why getting around without a car is hard. Even if a shop is just a few minutes walk away, most Americans still will sit in to their car. There are even "drive-thru‚Äù pharmacies, banks and even churches! Without a car here you feel like you are without hands.</p>

                            <p class="text7">Americans celebrate Halloween especially loud - houses are decorated like they came from a horror movie scene, children are running around dressed in the strangest costumes, and adults throw themed parties. Additionally, is is candy heaven - the tradition of "Trick or treating‚Äù lets kids gather more candy than they eat in a year! Some neighbours even organise competitions, whose houses look the creepiest. </p>

Also, they often hug when greeting, and that for some Europeans seems too personal. However, in America it‚Äôs common - the more smiles and "small talk‚Äù, the better!

                            <p class="text7">In America dates are written as a month-day-year format, which often misleads the rest of the world. For example, 07/04/2025 means July 4th, and not April 7th. That can cause a lot of confusion for travellers or people, who handle documents. Even international companies often come across with situations, when something is ordered or reserved with a wrong date.</p>

                            <p class="text7">Price tags in stores show the total without taxes, therefore at the checkout a surprise may be waiting for you. Depending on the state, you may have to from a few to a dozen percent more than you expected. And just like that, even the tip left on restaurant receipts is not included in the price, so the final amount is always higher than you planned.
